# quantum-checkers

Checkers, but each "piece" is a probability distribution that spreads out over time.

The winner is the first to drop their opponent's total probability score below 1 piece.

### Todo

- entanglement instead of expected values
    - how to do this without exponentially-growing space requirements??
- AI to play against
- UI
    - pie chart representation of each probability?
    - option to look at the individual prob. distributions of each piece
